Introduction to NumPy

What is NumPy?
NumPy (Numerical Python) is Python's fundamental package for scientific computing. It provides:

A powerful N-dimensional array object (ndarray)

Tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code

Useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities


Key Features
1.Fast array processing - Much faster than Python lists

2.Vectorized operations - Apply operations to entire arrays without loops

3.Broadcasting - Perform operations on arrays of different shapes

4.Linear algebra tools - Matrix operations, decompositions, etc.
